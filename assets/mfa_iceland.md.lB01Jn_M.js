I declare the following facts:</p><ol><li><strong>Constitutional Crisis:</strong> Since 1996, the governing bodies in Ukraine have failed to execute the Transitional Provisions of the Constitution, effectively operating in a legal vacuum. Subsequent amendments (2004, 2010, 2014) were enacted without the mandatory Referendum (as per Art. 5 &amp; 156), rendering the current regime a <strong>private commercial administration</strong> rather than a constitutional state representing the People.</li><li><strong>Internal Genocide:</strong> The current administration is conducting a de-facto genocide against the indigenous population through economic strangulation, unlawful mobilization of &quot;persons&quot; (ignoring human status), and total disregard for the sanctity of life.</li><li><strong>Lack of Protection &amp; Denial of Rights:</strong> As a Living Man who refuses to participate in this unlawful corporate conflict, I have been stripped of basic resources, subjected to physical violence (concussion, robbery by police), and denied medical aid. Furthermore, in Germany, I was denied even basic employment (including McDonald&#39;s) solely due to my status, mirroring the discriminatory practices of totalitarian regimes of the 1930s.</li><li><strong>Crimes Against Humanity:</strong> The systematic denial of rights to life, work, and dignity for those who do not consent to the &quot;war system&quot; constitutes a crime against humanity, perpetrated not only by the aggressor but also by states that enforce these discriminatory corporate statutes against living people.</li></ol><h2 id="my-offer-intent" tabindex="-1">MY OFFER &amp; INTENT <a class="header-anchor" href="#my-offer-intent" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;MY OFFER &amp; INTENT&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I am <strong>NOT</strong> asking for &quot;refugee status&quot; (which places me back under Maritime/Admiralty Law as cargo). I am asking for <strong>Sanctuary and the Right to Live and Work</strong> as a Free Man.</p><p>I am a skilled <strong>Engineer and Technologist</strong> (projects attached: UCTS, H2Gen).
