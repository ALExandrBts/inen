My childhood was marked by a legal anomaly. Holding two passports (Ukraine/Russia) due to the USSR collapse, I became a hostage of a system that used this collision as a weapon against my sovereignty.</p></div><div class="history-block"><h3 id="_2014-—-war-in-donbass" tabindex="-1">2014 — War in Donbass <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2014-—-war-in-donbass" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2014 — War in Donbass&quot;">​</a></h3><p>War took my home, my family, and my sense of stability.
