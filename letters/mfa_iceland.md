# NOTICE OF PRESENCE & CLAIM OF RIGHT
**To:** Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Iceland  
**Date:** February 2026  
**From:** Aleksandr Snigirev, a Living Man  

---

## DECLARATION OF STATUS

I, Aleksandr Snigirev, stand before you as a **Living Man**, a subject of Natural Law, and a holder of inalienable rights as defined by **Article 6 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights**. I am NOT a "person", "individual", or any other corporate fiction created by state statutes, but a sovereign being endowed with conscience and free will.

## THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT & LEGAL VACUUM

I am forced to seek sanctuary due to a systemic collapse of rule of law in my territory of origin (Ukraine). I declare the following facts:

1.  **Constitutional Crisis:** Since 1996, the governing bodies in Ukraine have failed to execute the Transitional Provisions of the Constitution, effectively operating in a legal vacuum. Subsequent amendments (2004, 2010, 2014) were enacted without the mandatory Referendum (as per Art. 5 & 156), rendering the current regime a **private commercial administration** rather than a constitutional state representing the People.
2.  **Internal Genocide:** The current administration is conducting a de-facto genocide against the indigenous population through economic strangulation, unlawful mobilization of "persons" (ignoring human status), and total disregard for the sanctity of life. 
3.  **Lack of Protection & Denial of Rights:** As a Living Man who refuses to participate in this unlawful corporate conflict, I have been stripped of basic resources, subjected to physical violence (concussion, robbery by police), and denied medical aid. Furthermore, in Germany, I was denied even basic employment (including McDonald's) solely due to my status, mirroring the discriminatory practices of totalitarian regimes of the 1930s.
4. **Crimes Against Humanity:** The systematic denial of rights to life, work, and dignity for those who do not consent to the "war system" constitutes a crime against humanity, perpetrated not only by the aggressor but also by states that enforce these discriminatory corporate statutes against living people.

## MY OFFER & INTENT

I am **NOT** asking for "refugee status" (which places me back under Maritime/Admiralty Law as cargo). 
I am asking for **Sanctuary and the Right to Live and Work** as a Free Man.

I am a skilled **Engineer and Technologist** (projects attached: UCTS, H2Gen). I do not seek handouts. I seek a jurisdiction that respects Human Rights where I can:
1.  Apply my skills in renewable energy and materials science for the benefit of your people.
2.  Live in peace without threat to my biological existence.
3.  Pay for my existence through honest labor.

**I choose Iceland** (and the Nordic nations) because of your historical respect for freedom and human dignity. 

I arrive not as a burden, but as a creator.
