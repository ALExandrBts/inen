## Timeline of Injustice

<div class="home-container">
<div class="timeline">

<div class="event">
  <div class="year">1993-2001</div>
  <div class="content"><h3 class="no-hash">Citizenship Trap</h3><p>Born in Donbass, a land of labor and great challenges. My childhood was marked by a legal anomaly. Holding two passports (Ukraine/Russia) due to the USSR collapse, I became a hostage of a system that used this collision as a weapon against my sovereignty.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="event">
  <div class="year">2014</div>
  <div class="content"><h3 class="no-hash">War in Donbass</h3><p>War took my home, my family, and my sense of stability. After 2014, my property was illegally alienated. This was the beginning of my journey as a human who must defend his right to exist.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="event">
  <div class="year">2017</div>
  <div class="content"><h3 class="no-hash">Engineering Breakthrough</h3><p>I did not give up. Creating the UCTS prototype was the result of my desire to turn destruction into energy. This is an engineering answer to the ecological crisis.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="event">
  <div class="year">2021</div>
  <div class="content"><h3 class="no-hash">Global Recognition</h3><p>The Solar-H2 patent was recognized as an innovative solution for the maritime industry. Global recognition of my developments confirmed that I am on the right path.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="event">
  <div class="year">2023</div>
  <div class="content"><h3 class="no-hash">Eco-Integration</h3><p>Development of Moss Tile — a natural urban cooling system. Integrating technology into nature for a balanced and sovereign future.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="event">
  <div class="year">2024</div>
  <div class="content"><h3 class="no-hash">Systemic Oppression</h3><p>Today I am fighting against bureaucratic oppression in Germany. Deprivation of rights to medical assistance and movement is a modern form of torture aimed at breaking the will. But I am a Living Man, and I continue to create.</p></div>
