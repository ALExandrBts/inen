I, Aleksandr Snigirev, by this public declaration declare the presence of a Living Man, endowed with spirit, conscience, and inalienable rights received by birthright on Earth.

This declaration is based on the **UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights** (Articles 1, 3, 6, 13, 14, 15) and higher Natural Law.

### 1. Legal Status
I declare that I am not a "natural person", "economic resource", or any other legal fiction created by the state without my conscious consent. I act as a free man, sovereign of my life. My presence on this Earth is self-sufficient, and my rights to life, liberty, and creativity are absolute and inalienable.

### 2. Essence of Claim and Human Rights Violations
For the past year, I have been under unprecedented and systemic bureaucratic pressure within the Federal Republic of Germany. This pressure manifests as follows:
- **Deprivation of Freedom of Movement**: My right to free choice of residence and movement is groundlessly restricted.
- **Restriction of Right to Life and Health**: I have been denied access to necessary medical assistance, creating a direct threat to my health.
- **Psychological Pressure**: The system creates "digital ghetto" conditions, attempting to force me to renounce my beliefs and sovereign status.

These actions are direct violations of fundamental human rights and may qualify as torture and inhumane treatment.

### 3. Request for Protection and Recognition
I officially appeal to the Government and People of the Republic of Iceland, as a country with deep traditions of respect for human rights and individual sovereignty:
- **I request political asylum** and international protection from systemic persecution.
- **I request recognition of my status as a Living Man** and the opportunity to realize my engineering and creative projects for the benefit of humanity.

My developments (UCTS, Solar-H2) are aimed at solving global energy and environmental problems. I am ready to direct my intellectual potential to the development of Iceland and the World.
