## Chronicle of Injustice

<div class="home-container">
<div class="timeline">

<div class="event">
  <div class="year">1993-2001</div>
  <div class="content"><h3 class="no-hash">Citizenship Trap</h3><p>I was born in Donbas — a land of labor and great challenges. My childhood was marked by a legal anomaly. Having received two passports (Ukraine and Russia) due to the collapse of the USSR, I became a hostage to a system that used this collision as a weapon against my sovereignty.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="event">
  <div class="year">2014</div>
  <div class="content"><h3 class="no-hash">War in Donbas</h3><p>The war took away my home, family, and sense of stability. After 2014, my property was illegally seized. This was the beginning of my path as a person who must defend their right to exist.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="event">
  <div class="year">2017</div>
  <div class="content"><h3 class="no-hash">Engineering Breakthrough</h3><p>I did not give up. Creating the UCTS (Universal Carbon Transformation System) prototype was the result of my desire to turn destruction into energy. This is an engineering response to the ecological crisis.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="event">
  <div class="year">2021</div>
  <div class="content"><h3 class="no-hash">International Recognition</h3><p>The Solar-H2 patent was recognized as an innovative solution for the maritime industry. Global recognition of my developments confirmed that I am on the right path.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="event">
  <div class="year">2023</div>
  <div class="content"><h3 class="no-hash">Eco-Integration</h3><p>Development of Moss Tile — a natural cooling system for cities. Integrating technology into nature for a balanced and sovereign future.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="event">
  <div class="year">2024</div>
  <div class="content"><h3 class="no-hash">Systemic Oppression</h3><p>Today I fight against bureaucratic oppression in Germany. Deprivation of rights to medical care and movement is a modern form of torture aimed at breaking the will. But I am a Living Human, and I continue to create.</p></div>
