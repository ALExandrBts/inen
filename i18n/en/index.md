## Chronicle of Injustice

<div class="home-container">
<div class="timeline">

<div class="event">
  <div class="year">1993-2001</div>
  <div class="content"><h3 class="no-hash">Citizenship Trap</h3><p>I was born in Donbas — a land of labor and great challenges. My childhood was marked by a legal anomaly. Having received two passports (Ukraine and Russia) due to the collapse of the USSR, I became a hostage to a system that used this collision as a weapon against my sovereignty.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="event">
  <div class="year">2014</div>
  <div class="content"><h3 class="no-hash">War in Donbas</h3><p>The war took away my home, family, and sense of stability. After 2014, my property was illegally seized. This was the beginning of my path as a person who must defend their right to exist.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="event">
  <div class="year">2020-2022</div>
  <div class="content"><h3 class="no-hash">Human Rights Activism</h3><p>Active participation in the movement for medical cannabis legalization in Ukraine together with the "Rastamany Ukraine" bloggers. Fighting for people's right to alternative treatment and reduction of suffering.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="event">
  <div class="year">2024</div>
  <div class="content"><h3 class="no-hash">Systemic Oppression</h3><p>Today I fight against bureaucratic oppression in Germany. Deprivation of rights to medical care and movement is a modern form of torture aimed at breaking the will. But I am a Living Human, and I continue to create.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="event">
  <div class="year">2025</div>
  <div class="content"><h3 class="no-hash">Ecological Projects</h3><p>Development of three innovative solutions: UCTS (Universal Carbon Transformation System) — transforming toxic red mud into energy; Solar-H2 — hybrid maritime propulsion using hydrogen and solar power; Moss Tile — natural urban cooling system using moss. Integrating technology into nature for a sovereign future.</p></div>
