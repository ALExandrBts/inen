### 1993-2001 — Citizenship Trap

Born in Donbass, a land of labor and great challenges. My childhood was marked by a legal anomaly. Holding two passports (Ukraine/Russia) due to the USSR collapse, I became a hostage of a system that used this collision as a weapon against my sovereignty.

### 2014 — War in Donbass

War took my home, my family, and my sense of stability. After 2014, my property was illegally alienated. This was the beginning of my journey as a human who must defend his right to exist.

### 2020-2022 — Human Rights Activism

Active participation in the movement for medical cannabis legalization in Ukraine. Collaboration with the "Rastamany Ukraine" bloggers — a community fighting for people's right to alternative treatment. We advocated for reducing suffering of cancer patients and people with chronic pain who lack access to effective pain relief. This was a time of active civic engagement and public advocacy.

### 2024 — Systemic Oppression

Today I am fighting against bureaucratic oppression in Germany. Deprivation of rights to medical assistance and movement is a modern form of torture aimed at breaking the will. But I am a Living Man, and I continue to create.

### 2025 — Ecological Projects

Development of three innovative solutions for a sustainable future:

**UCTS (Universal Carbon Transformation System)** — a system for transforming toxic red mud from the aluminum industry into energy and building materials. An engineering response to the ecological crisis.

**Solar-H2** — a hybrid maritime propulsion system combining hydrogen fuel cells and solar power. An innovative solution for decarbonizing the maritime industry.

**Moss Tile** — a natural urban cooling system using living moss. Integrating technology into nature for a balanced and sovereign future.
