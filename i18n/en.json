  "detailed_history_body": "\n\n### 1993-2001: Citizenship Trap\n\nMy childhood was marked by a legal anomaly. Holding two passports (Ukraine/Russia) due to the USSR collapse, I became a hostage of a system that used this collision as a weapon against my sovereignty.\n\n### 2014: War in Donbass\n\nWar took my home, my family, and my sense of stability. After 2014, my property was illegally alienated. This was the beginning of my journey as a human who must defend his right to exist.\n\n### 2017: Engineering Breakthrough\n\nI did not give up. Creating the UCTS prototype was the result of my desire to turn destruction into energy. Seeking independent energy solutions.\n\n### 2021: Global Recognition\n\nThe world recognized my developments. The Solar-H2 patent confirmed that my ideas could save the maritime industry. Worldwide validation of my projects.\n\n### 2023: Eco-Integration\n\nDevelopment of Moss Tile — a natural urban cooling system. Integrating technology with nature.\n\n### 2024: Systemic Oppression\n\nToday I am fighting against bureaucratic oppression in Germany. Deprivation of rights to medical assistance and movement is a modern form of torture. But I am a Living Man, and I continue to create.\n\n        "
