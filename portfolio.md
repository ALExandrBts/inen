# Engineering Portfolio

I build solutions that solve critical global problems: energy waste, fuel inefficiency, and sustainable construction.

## 1. UCTS: Upcycled Ceramic Thermal Storage

*   **Problem:** Aluminum production creates toxic "Red Mud" (177M tons/year). Renewable energy needs cheap storage.
*   **Solution:** A patented ceramic material (**URC-1**) made from Red Mud.
    *   Stores heat up to 1000°C.
    *   Cost: **$13.6/kWh** (vs $150-300 for Li-Ion).
    *   Lifecycle: 40+ years.
*   **Status:** Technology proven, R&D roadmap ready.

## 2. Solar-H₂ Boost (Maritime)
*   **Problem:** River barges burn immense amounts of diesel and pollute waterways.
*   **Solution:** A hybrid retrofit system.
    *   **Hydrogen Injection:** Electrolyzers produce H₂ on board to enrich fuel mix.
    *   **Solar Array:** Flexible panels on deck (200kWp).
    *   **Result:** +7% Torque, -30% Fuel Consumption, -80% Emissions.

## 3. Moss Tile (Eco-Construction)
*   **Problem:** Concrete production is CO2 heavy. Northern climates struggle with green roofs.
*   **Solution:** Bio-composite lightweight tiles.
    *   Made from recycled plastic and sand.
    *   Substrate for growing local mosses (Sphagnum).
    *   Insulates homes, captures carbon, restores biodiversity.
